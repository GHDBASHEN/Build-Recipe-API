# Build Recipe API

## Overview

The **Build Recipe API** is a web application that allows users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have available. Users can input a single ingredient, and the application will return a list of recipes that include that ingredient, along with detailed instructions and nutritional information.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to:
- **Build a RESTful API**: Create an API that allows users to interact with the recipe database by searching for recipes based on available ingredients.
- **Test the API with Postman**: Use Postman to send requests to the API, validate its functionality, and ensure it returns the expected results.


## Features

- **Ingredient-Based Search**: Users can enter any ingredient to find matching recipes.
- **Dynamic Recipe Display**: Recipes are displayed with their ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: The application features a clean and intuitive design for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Storage**: JSON file for storing recipes
- **Libraries**: Flask-CORS for handling CORS issues
